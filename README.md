# ðŸš€ SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction  

## **Project Description**  
This project is part of the **IBM Data Science Capstone**. The goal is to predict whether the first stage of SpaceXâ€™s Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land after launch.  

SpaceX offers Falcon 9 launches for approximately **$62 million**, while other providers charge over **$165 million**. A significant portion of the savings comes from the **reusability of the first stage**.  

By predicting the landing success of the first stage, we can estimate the cost of a launch and help alternative companies **compete against SpaceX** in the rocket launch market.
